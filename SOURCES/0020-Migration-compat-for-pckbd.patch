Subject: Migration compat for pckbd

From: "Dr. David Alan Gilbert" <dgilbert@redhat.com>

2.2 added a new subsection to the pc keyboard model to preserve
the value of 'outport' across migration; to maintain migration
backwards compatibility this patch disables it on older machine types.
This leaves us no-worse-off than in older versions.

Even with the new code, the value migrated in 'outport' isn't used
anywhere in the pckbd model; for example the value migrated doesn't
change the state of the A20 line or potentially do a reset.

The only effect, as far as I can tell is if the guest were to
explicitly read the outport value it might get a more sensible reply.
